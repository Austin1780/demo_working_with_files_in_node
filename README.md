Demo for working with files in Node


### Getting Started

Be sure to run `$ node _create_big_file.js` before running any files that work with `data/big.txt`. Github will not accept files bigger than 100MB so in order to work with a large file it must be created locally. It is `.gitignore`d for this repo.
